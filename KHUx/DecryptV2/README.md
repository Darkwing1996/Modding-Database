# How to use
- Put the file to be extracted in this folder.
- Launch DecryptMP4.bat
- Provide the file name
- Find your output files in the newly created folder

# Advanced

## There are two tools:

# DecryptV2
- Extracts the files using the new file format (such as jpg and MP4)

# fileID
- Tries to rename the files based on the header

If you're using an MP4 file then the bat file is more convenient.

However, if you're decrypting a JPG/GIF...etc file, using DecryptV2 alone will be enough in most cases.




SPECIAL THANKS TO [/u/ebaroni83](https://www.reddit.com/user/ebaroni83) for the new decryption format.
