# KHUxEncrypt
### Use this tool to Encrypt the files after decryption using KhuxDecrypt ###

##### Usage: 

- KHUxEncrypt FileName InternalName(Optional)

  -	FileName is the name of the file to open
  
  -	InterName not required, but is the name of the file internally.
  
  -	 	You use the Internal Name only if you wish to have the file name different than the internal name
  
  -		for example, you use KhuxDecrypt on a banner and you get the file "data" but you wish to rename it to something else for easier editing, so you rename it to DataEdit.png, then you run the tool using:
  
  -		KHUxEncrypt DataEdit.png data
  
  -		This will Encrypt the file DataEdit.png as if it was called "data".
