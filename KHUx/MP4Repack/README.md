### Repack an MP4 file!
Place your MP4 file in this folder (needed for file listing only)
Make sure that the mp4 files are ALL inside "filename_folder" With the Extension.
Run the tool and type the MP4 name (with extension).

### Example:
If you want to repack MP4Test.mp4, then make a folder called MP4Test.mp4_folder which has all the files inside.
Run the tool and type MP4Test.mp4

# Update:

#### MP4Repack+PNG now fixes the PNG so that the images display correctly.
#### Have the MP4 and its respective PNG file in the same folder under the same name. Run MP4Repack+PNG.bat and type in the name of the mp4 with the extension.
